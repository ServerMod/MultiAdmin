# MultiAdmin
MultiAdmin is a replacement server tool for SCP: Secret Laboratory, which was built to help enable servers to have multiple configurations per server instance.

The latest release can be found here: [Release link](https://github.com/ServerMod/MultiAdmin/releases/latest)

### Running a Single Server with MultiAdmin
1. Place MultiAdmin.exe in your root server directory (next to LocalAdmin.exe)

### Running Multiple Servers with MultiAdmin
1. Place MultiAdmin.exe in your root server directory (next to LocalAdmin.exe)
2. Create a new directory defined by `servers_folder` (`servers` by default)
3. For each server you'd like, create a directory within the `servers_folder` directory
4. Optional: Create a file named `scp_multiadmin.cfg` within your server's folder for configuring MultiAdmin specifically for that server

## MultiAdmin Execution Arguments
The arguments available for running MultiAdmin with

- `--headless` or `-h`: Runs MultiAdmin in headless mode, this makes MultiAdmin not accept any input at all and only output to log files, not in console (Note: This argument is inherited by processes started by this MultiAdmin process)
- `--server-id <Server ID>` or `-id <Server ID>`: The Server ID to run this MultiAdmin instance with a config location (`--config` or `-c`) so that it reads the configs from the location, but stores the logs in the Server ID's folder
- `--config <Config Location>` or `-c <Config Location>`: The config location to use for this MultiAdmin instance (Note: This is used over the config option `config_location`)
- `--port <Server Port>` or `-p <Server Port>`: The port to use for this MultiAdmin instance (Note: This is used over the config option `port` and is inherited by processes started by this MultiAdmin process)

## Config Settings
All configuration settings go into a file named `scp_multiadmin.cfg` in the same directory as MultiAdmin.exe or in your server directory within the `servers_folder` value defined in the global configuration file
Any configuration files within the directory defined by `servers_folder` will have it's values used for that server over the global configuration file

## ConsoleInputSystem
If you are running into issues with the `tmux send-keys` command, switch to the original input system.

String Value | Integer Value | Description
--- | :---: | :----:
Original | 0 | Represents the original input system. It may prevent MultiAdmin from closing and/or cause ghost game processes.
Old | 1 | Represents the old input system. This input system should operate similarly to the original input system but won't cause issues with MultiAdmin's functionality.
New | 2 | Represents the new input system. The main difference from the original input system is an improved display.
