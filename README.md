## Installation Instructions:
1. Place MultiAdmin.exe next to your LocalAdmin.exe
2. Create a new folder called servers within the same folder as LocalAdmin/MultiServer
3. For each instance with a unique config, create a new directory in the servers directory and place each config.txt in there, so for example for two unique configs:
* servers/FirstServer/config.txt
* servers/SecondServer/config.txt
4. If your config is not in its default location due to a different OS and such, make a new file next to MultiAdmin.exe called scp_multiadmin.cfg and place the follwing setting like so:
- cfg_loc=%appdata%\SCP Secret Laboratory\config.txt

# ServerMod
ServerMod is an additional tool i have developed to add more configuration settings, fix bugs, and attempt to make servers more stable where possible. You dont need multiadmin for this, but it is recommended!

The latest release can be found here: [Release link](https://github.com/Grover-c13/MultiAdmin/releases/latest)

## Features:
- Fixes as many null reference errors as i can find, making your log files smaller.
- Dynamic server names with player count etc.
- Increasing the player count.
- Disabling of SCPs
- Configuring max class healths.
- Anti-nuke spam.


## ServerMod Installation:
To install:
1. Navigate to your SCP Secret Lab folder.
